Title: Valid Anagram
Link: https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/127/strings/882/

Description:
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the strings s and t.
- Space Complexity: O(1), since the count arrays have a fixed size of 26 for lowercase alphabets.
