Title: Valid Palindrome
Link: https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/127/strings/883/

Description:
Given a string s, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Example 1:
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: The given string is a palindrome, reading the same forward and backward, while ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case.

Example 2:
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: The given string is not a palindrome, as it does not read the same forward and backward.

Note:
- You may assume the string contains only lowercase or uppercase letters and/or digits.

Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string s.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as the algorithm uses constant space.
