Title: Reverse Linked List
Link: https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/93/linked-list/560/

Description:
Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL

Note:
A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n) for both iterative and recursive solutions.
- Space Complexity: O(1) for the iterative solution, O(n) for the recursive solution due to the call stack.
