Example:
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]

Explanation:
You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because the deletion operation takes constant time.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) because it does not require any extra space.

Note:
- The given node is not the tail of the linked list.
- The linked list will have at least two nodes.
- The node to be deleted is guaranteed to be in the linked list.
