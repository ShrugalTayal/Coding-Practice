## Hamming Distance

**Problem Description:**

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Example 1:**

Input: `x = 1`, `y = 4`
- The binary representation of `1` is `001`.
- The binary representation of `4` is `100`.
- The Hamming distance between `1` and `4` is `2` since they differ at two positions: `2nd` and `3rd`.

Output: `2`

**Example 2:**

Input: `x = 3`, `y = 1`
- The binary representation of `3` is `011`.
- The binary representation of `1` is `001`.
- The Hamming distance between `3` and `1` is `1` since they differ at one position: `1st`.

Output: `1`

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= x, y <= 2^31 - 1`
