Title: Plus One

Link: [Plus One - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/92/array/559/)

Description:
The "Plus One" problem asks to add one to a given integer represented as an array of digits. The digits are stored in reverse order, with the least significant digit at the 0th index.

The provided code implements the solution to this problem. It converts the array of digits to a string, removes the square brackets, and joins the digits into a single string. Then, it converts the string to an integer, increments it by 1, and converts it back to a string. The string is then converted back to a list of individual digits, and the final list is returned.

The code has been commented to explain each step of the process. It handles cases where the digits may exceed the range of a single digit (e.g., carrying over to the next digit).

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input list.
