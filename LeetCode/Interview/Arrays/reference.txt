Problem Description: "Rotate Array" is a problem that requires you to rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps. Given an array and a non-negative integer k, the task is to rotate the array in-place by k steps. The rotation should be performed without using extra space, meaning the original array should be modified.

The problem challenges you to come up with an efficient algorithm to shift the elements of the array to the right by k positions, with elements that exceed the original array's length wrapping around and appearing at the beginning.
