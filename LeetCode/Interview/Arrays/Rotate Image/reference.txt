In this problem, you are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image. You need to rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise) in-place. The problem asks you to modify the matrix directly, without using extra space.

The provided solution implements the rotation algorithm. It transposes the matrix and then reverses each row to achieve the desired rotation. The algorithm modifies the matrix in-place and does not return anything.

Feel free to refer to the solution for a detailed implementation.
