Title: Single Number

Description:
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single number.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Explanation: In this example, 1 is the single number as it appears only once while all other elements appear twice.

Note:
- The given array will always contain only integers.
- The array size will be at least 1.

This problem requires finding the element that occurs only once in an array where all other elements occur twice. The goal is to find a solution that has a linear runtime complexity (O(n)) and uses constant extra space (O(1)).
